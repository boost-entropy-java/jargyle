/**
 * Helper class for reading and writing measured I/O for testing. Measured
 * data as input or output allows for the original data of variable length to
 * be read fully.
 * <p>
 * Measured data is organized in groups of bytes. Each group of bytes is
 * called a chunk. Each chunk begins with a byte called the chunk length byte.
 * If the value of the chuck length byte is between 0 and 254 (inclusive),
 * then that value indicates the number of bytes after the chunk length byte
 * with no further chunks to be followed. If the value of the chunk length
 * byte is 255, then that value indicates 254 bytes after the chunk length
 * byte and another chunk to be followed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Original data is decoded from the measured data by aggregating all of the
 * bytes that are not the chunk length bytes from the chunks of the measured
 * data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Original data of a length of 254 bytes or less is encoded as measured data
 * of only one chunk with a chunk length byte of the value of the length of
 * the bytes of the original data followed by the bytes of the original data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Original data of a length greater than 254 bytes is encoded as measured
 * data of many chunks whose number is the length of the bytes of the original
 * data divided by 254 and rounded up to the next whole number if there is a
 * remainder. Each chunk, with the exception of the last chunk, has a chunk
 * length byte of a value of 255 followed by the next 254 bytes of the
 * original data. The last chunk has a chunk length byte of the value of the
 * length of the remaining bytes of the original data followed by the
 * remaining bytes of the original data.
 * </p>
