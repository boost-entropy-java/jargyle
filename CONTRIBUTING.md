# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in Jargyle! The goal is to make Jargyle as useful
as possible. Your input is most welcome. Please note that there is a code of
conduct that is followed moving forward in all your interactions with the
project. At the moment, you can contribute in any of the following ways:

-   [Reporting a bug](#reporting-a-bug)
-   [Proposing new features](#proposing-new-features)

### Reporting a Bug

Bugs are reported using GitHub's Issues. You can report a bug by opening a new
issue [here](https://github.com/jh3nd3rs0n/jargyle/issues). Ideally, a good bug report would have the following:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce the bug (Be specific and give code examples if you can)
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Additional notes (possibly including why you think this might be
    happening, or stuff you tried but didn't work.)

The more thorough the bug report the better.

### Proposing new features

Like reporting a bug, proposal for new features can be submitted using
GitHub's Issues. You can propose a new feature by opening a new issue
[here](https://github.com/jh3nd3rs0n/jargyle/issues).
